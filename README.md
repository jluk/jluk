## 👋 Hey I'm Justin! 

My day job is a product manager, but I love hacking on AI at all times. My personal passions include Crossfit, Motorcycles, and Backpacking.

## What do you spend time on?

- Vibe coding projects ([jluk.me](jluk.me))
- :pencil2: [Write about tech & product management on Medium](https://medium.com/@justinluk)
- Often day dreaming about playing music :musical_note:, building new things :hammer:, and my St. Bernard :dog:.
