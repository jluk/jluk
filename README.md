## ðŸ‘‹ Hey I'm Justin! 

My day job is product management for [Azure](https://github.com/Azure), specifically on building managed [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes). You'll see work related projects, demos, technical documentation, and the occasional bug fix on this page.

## What do you spend time on?

- :boat: [Maintainer for AKS github](https://github.com/Azure/AKS)
- :pencil2: [Write about tech & product management on Medium](https://medium.com/@justinluk)
- Often day dreaming about playing music :musical_note:, building new things :hammer:, and my St. Bernard :dog:.
